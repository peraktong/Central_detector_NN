# Central_galaxy_detector
 Jason's toy model for central galaxt detection using machine learning algorithm <br>
 Here I construct a mock from N-body simulation with 250 Mpc/h box. The stellar mass and luminosity are from abundance matching with a fixed scatter. <br>
 Gradient boost tree and Neural network are used as our central galaxy detection techniques, which have similar results. <br>
 I include ROC curve for the neural network model, which is useful in model evaluation for imbalance classifier. <br>
 A toy model. I need to further this about this method. Need to inlcude more physics :)
 20190925: Now I include mock for TNg100/300 using labels which are also available in observation (Eg: SLOAN) <br>
 Magnitude, metallicity, stellar mass and star formation rate are considered.
